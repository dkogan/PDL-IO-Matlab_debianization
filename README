PDL-IO-Matlab

Read and write matlab files. For matlab file
format version 7.3, the hdf5 library must be
present. For compression in matlab file format
version 5, the zlib library must be present.
In any case, version 5 compression is not
yet supported in the interface for writing.

The pdl data types for a particular pdl build
(linux  amd64) are hardcoded. This should be
fixed to make this module more portable.

* MATIO SOURCE

The matio source is included.  But several things
are removed to make the source much smaller.

In ./documentation and ./test, only the Makefiles are
kept; so that configure succeeds.

./configure/texinfo.tex is removed
